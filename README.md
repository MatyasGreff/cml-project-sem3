## Machine Learnig Project
> A proposal and execution of a research project using machine
learning techniques.


This project proposes a machine learning solution that based on historical data collected from Fortnite and Call of Duty, will provide some information related to players performance. Information like: based on solo win ratio, predict duo win ratio; the more enemies you kill, more often you going to win? based on player level, what is the number of wins?
These questions are basically to give some insights to these players and so, making them able to choose and understand their way of playing. 



### Artifacts

- jupyter notebooks files (.ipynb )-- used to do first data analysis and create model
- pickle files (pkl)-- expored model to be used on application
- datasets -- datasets used on project
- app -- application developed using Streamlit Python library



### How to run application locally

On the app folther run: 
```
pip install streamlit
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```
